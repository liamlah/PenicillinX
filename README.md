# PenicillinX
A Shiny web app that compares the molecular components of common $\beta$-lactam antibiotics with the goal to assist clinicians with antibiotic selection for patients with previous history of reactions.

## Warning:

The app is currently in development and should not be used in any clinical decision making. At present there is key information relating to functional groups missing from the database.

If you wish to give feedback, you can test a live version of the app [here](https://liamjones.shinyapps.io/PenicillinX/)
